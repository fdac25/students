My name is Cameron Rader and I'm a Masters student in Computer Science specializing in Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. I am currently pursuing research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,
more specifically their application into existing business processes. I don't know much at all about Digital Archeology, however I am excited to learn what all it entails. I recieved my undergraduate degree from 
Christian Brothers University in Memphis, TN in Computer Science while also playing soccer for the school. I am currently a GRA for the High Performance Scientific Computing group, assiting researchers with their work
on the university's computing resources.
