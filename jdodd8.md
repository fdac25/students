I am Jackson Dodd and I am a senior in Computer Science here at UTK. I am minoring in Data Science and Cybersecurity and am interested in data security and facilitating safe transmission of data. I've had experience with data collection on physical devices, but I'm interested in getting more experience with data collection and wrangling in a more digital space.
