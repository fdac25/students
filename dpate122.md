I am Dhruv Patel and I am a senior Computer Science student, with a minor in Cybdersecurity. Through this course, I want to strengthen my skills in collaborative development, version control, and working with real-world data and workflows. I hope to gain practical experience that prepares me for industry projects while also improving my ability to contribute effectively in a team environment.
