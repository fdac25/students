I am Jakob Brown, a senior in computer science. I am most interested in machine learning, particularly on an enterprise scale.
I have a particular interest in how we can deploy tech at a large enterprise, and how each system interacts at that scale. I am familiar with networking and cloud infrastructure. 
I don't know much about digital archaeology; however, I am curious to see how I can apply what I learn here.
