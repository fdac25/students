My name is Reagan Sanz, and I am currently a CS Grad student. I enjoy reading books/comics and playing far too much Marvel Rivals for my own good. A fun fact is that I was a combination CS and art student in undergrad. I love making art and I worked on the assets/UI for the video game my group made in Senior Design. I'm hoping to learn more about how to collect and curate data in this course. Last semester, I fine-tuned an LLM to recommend Netflix Movies, but I found that collecting data was more difficult than I realized.
